# Spotify ETL Data Pipeline End-to-end Project
This is an ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) Data Pipeline project using Spotify API. In this we extracted the data from the spotify API and stored it on AWS S3 bucket, then transformed the data to desired format, and then finally load it on target S3 folder.
